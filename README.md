# CS314 Term Project

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application with separate frontend and backend components.

## Directory Structure
```
CS314TermProject/
├── frontend/     # Frontend application
└── backend/      # Backend server
```

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server:
```
npm start
```
The server should start running on http://localhost:3000 (or another port specified in the code).

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:
```
npm start
```
The frontend application should open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is already in use).

## Running the Complete Application
1. Start the backend server in one terminal window (following the backend setup instructions)
2. Start the frontend server in another terminal window (following the frontend setup instructions)
3. Access the application through the frontend URL (typically http://localhost:3000)

## Additional Information
- The backend API endpoints are documented in the backend code
- The frontend communicates with the backend via these API endpoints
- Configuration files for both frontend and backend contain important settings

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or running the application:
1. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. Check if the specified ports are available
3. Look for error messages in the terminal output
4. Verify that environment variables are correctly set (if applicable)
